    Some basic types of attacks:
    --------------------------------------------------------

    - Injections: adding a database query to gain information and/or 
    tank your site. Solution? Mongo sanitation (see app.js)

    - Cross-site scripting or XSS: Injection of the attacker's own 
    client-side script on your app. Can do bad shit like report user's
    cookies, steals their info, maybe even controls their actions. Use
    XSS game to learn more about how it works. Solution? Use JOI to
    sanitize the HTML. Our main weakness against this is when we pass
    our campground in as javascript for our mapbox. We can also use
    express validator for sanitization/html escaping, but we're using 
    JOI because Colt hates the syntax lmao. JOI lets us create
    extensions that we can attach to our validation (see schemas.js).

    - We can also fix how we handle sessions/cookies for added protection. 
    Add "secure: true," under cookie settings in sessionConfig (however,
    localhost isn't https so this will break shit for now). We can also 
    get an easy win by manually naming our session. 

    - We also want to hide our errors when deploying, not include a stack 
    trace like we do in development. We can easily do this with an if/then
    slid into error.ejs

    - The package Helmet has 15 different middlewares for the purpose of 
    manipulating headers. app.use(helmet()) automatically uses all of them.
    At first we will disable content secureity policy because a lot of our
    images, maps, etc. violate it by default. Keep in mind the crossorigin
    fix. 

    Deploying 
    --------------------------------------------------------

    - We set up a production database seperate from a development database
    that isn't kept locally. We will be using MongoDB Atlas (paid but has
    a free tier). Set up a cluster, fetch a link to connect it, put it in
    the .env file, set up a seperate connection in app.js

    - Next we configure our app to store session info using mongo, as it
    defaults to storing in memory (bad!! scales poorly). We use the 
    connect-mongo package for this. See the mongostore and store seetup 
    in app.js

    - ACTUAL DEPLOYMENT TIME, let's use Heroku to store/serve our app (with
    its free tier of course). Heroku tends to be the friendliest for
    beginners to deploy things like express apps. Once everything is
    installed and set up, open git bash and type in heroku login to log in

    - Use heroku create in git bash to make an app/url in heroku. Then
    git init to make a repository, then heroku git:remote -a <name of app>,
    then git remote -v to fetch a url that we can push our code up to. 
    SET YOUR GIT EMAIL AND USERNAME. Then type git add . and
    git commit -m "ready to try deploying", then git push heroku master. 
    We will be greeted with an error (oh joy!)

    - Our error was heroku logs --tail, which we put into git bash and can
    see that we lack a way to start the app! (Heroku is silly and doesn't
    know how to type nodemon app.js like us superior fleshy boys). We can 
    add this nto our package.json scripts to fix this. *Side note, you're 
    not supposed to have uppercase letters in your app name as it is read
    by the computer. We also need to tweak our port that we listen on,
    since heroku defaults to a certain value (not 3000). Next error is 
    "cannot create client without a token" seen after running app.js, which
    means the app runs, but they could not connect to a definted access token,
    which we can handle by configuring our heroku environment variables.

    - You can set env variables on the heroku website, or in your command
    line using heroku config:set <var name>=<key>

    - Make sure to whitelist all IP addresses on the atlas side of things,
    make sure to add/commit/git push heroku master any changes you make,
    also properly configure your env variables.
